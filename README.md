# WineQuality_Prognostic
Given a set of features as inputs, the task here is to predict the quality of wine on a scale of 0 - 10. I have solved it as a regression problem using Linear Regression.

# Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

i) fixed acidity
ii) volatile acidity
iii) citric acid
iv) residual sugar
v) chlorides
vi) free sulfur dioxide
vii) total sulfur dioxide
viii) density
ix) pH
x) sulphates
xii) alcohol

Output variable (based on sensory data): quality (score between 0 and 10)

# Dependencies
